How are emojis chosen?
Emojis can be suggested by anyone by submitting a written proposal to the Unicode Consortium. The Consortium has a committee dedicated to making sure the emoji list stays current and relevant by adding and deleting emojis each year. This is incredibly important, as emojis go through cultural changes, often acquiring new and sometimes unintended meanings, says Biscontini. After all, only 7% of people texting the peach emoji are using it to talk about fruit!
