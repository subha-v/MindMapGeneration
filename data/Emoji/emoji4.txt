When will Emoji 15.0 be released?
Right now, the new emojis are only proposed and still need to be approved by the Unicode Consortium when they meet in September 2022. The Unicode Consortium, by the way, is a nonprofit organization that ensures that all types of keyboard setups, including those in other languages, work with computers and phones, and it makes the final decision and approves the designs of any new emojis.

Once the Consortium members review the proposed emojis, they may also change the design a bit; the current pictures are just proposals. But most proposed emojis get approved, so look for this new crop to be released starting in the fall, possibly as early as September. The rollout will continue through the end of 2022 and into early 2023. Here are more emoji hacks for other ways to get your point across.

How do you get the new emojis?
If you have your Apple or Android device set to update automatically, you don’t need to do anything. The new emojis will be added to your keyboard with the next system update. If that doesn’t happen, you can always manually update your system by going to your device’s settings. In Settings, check to make sure your operating system, languages and keyboard are all up to date, and install the update if needed. Check out these iPhone hacks for more pro tips.
