Not sure how to convey a specific emotion? Want to make your messages more fun and colorful? Enjoy making puns and sharing inside jokes with friends? The answer: emojis! And we have great news. Soon, we’ll have 31 new emojis—including several new hearts, a moose and, yep, a panic emoji—to play with and use in texting abbreviations and emoji riddles.

The history of emojis is relatively short. They were invented in 1997 but didn’t become widely used until around 2010, and now, of course, they’re incredibly popular. Ninety-two percent of people say they use emojis in texts on a regular basis, while more than half of Instagram comments and one in five tweets contain at least one emoji, according to a survey conducted by Emojipedia.
